# Onebox-Email-Aggregator-
# ðŸ“¬ Onebox Email Aggregator

A featureâ€‘rich **Onebox email aggregator** built with **Node.js (TypeScript)**, **React (TypeScript)**, and **Elasticsearch**.  
It synchronizes multiple IMAP accounts in real time, indexes emails for search, categorizes them, and integrates with Slack and webhooks.  

---

## Features

 **Real-Time Email Synchronization**
- Connects to multiple IMAP accounts.
- Fetches last 30 days of emails.
- Uses persistent IMAP (IDLE mode) â€” no cron jobs.

 **Searchable Storage**
- Stores emails in a locally hosted **Elasticsearch** instance (via Docker).
- Search by keyword (and can extend to account/folder filters).

  **AI-Based Categorization (Basic)**
- Categorizes emails into:
  - Interested
  - Meeting Booked
  - Not Interested
  - Spam
  - Out of Office

  **Integrations**
- **Slack notification** for every new **Interested** email.
- **Webhook trigger** (using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)) when an email is marked as **Interested**.

 **Frontend Interface**
- Built with React & Tailwind CSS.
- View emails and their categories.
- Search functionality powered by Elasticsearch.

 **(Optional Advanced)** AI-powered suggested replies using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â€” not implemented in this version, but the backend is extendable.
